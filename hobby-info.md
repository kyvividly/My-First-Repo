My favorite hobby is *playing video games*, *watching movies*, *tv shows*, and *playing volleyball*.
I got interested in these hobbies by *interacting* with them a lot, which drew me towards it.
I spend *a lot of time* on games and movies, and I play volleyball outside.
I enjoy the *entertainment* that these hobbies bring.
I learned certain *techniques* in volleyball and when to use them from my friends.
I started volleyball around 6th grade, but I eventually got into it around early *8th grade*.
